# Charitable Windcave

Charitable Windcave allows you to accept donations through your Windcave payment processing account with Charitable. 

This integration uses Windcave's PxPay 2.0 API, which uses a hosted payment page on Windcave's servers to reduce PCI compliance requirements and provide a secure payment experience for donors.
